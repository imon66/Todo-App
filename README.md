Todos! In Angular + ASP.NET!
Seize the day... or not, it's up to you.
As a React developer diving into the world of Angular and ASP.NET Core, I created this app to manage a basic list of todo items right in your browser. If pen and paper aren't your thing, this app has got you covered.
Project Overview
This project aims to simulate a real web application with various advanced features, including:
•	A persistent SQL database
•	Custom API with CRUD operations
•	Backend DTO capabilities, including a 'secret' field
•	Stateful front-end logic
•	API calls
•	Responsive styling
Moving forward, I plan to enhance this application by adding more components and implementing unit tests. This project was generated with Angular CLI version 12.2.4 and an ASP.NET Core Web API.
